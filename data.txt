Julius Caesar
The Pax Romana was a period from roughly 27 BCE to 180 CE during which Rome experienced peace, stability, and expansion. Before this time, Rome had almost constantly been engaged in some major war, civil or otherwise. Roman citizens saw war as a good thing, because war meant conquest, conquest meant looting, capturing, enslaving, expanding, wealth, and power. Rome was at its largest during this time, reaching all the way to Asia. This period is often said to have begun with Octavian’s ascension after Julius Caesar. Caesar, a powerful governor returning home from his conquest of Gaul, had begun a civil war when he crossed into Rome with his legion against the Senate’s orders. He quickly defeated Pompey, his main opponent and powerful Senator, and became the dictator. Roman dictatorship, similar to martial law, bestowed the full authority of the state on a magistrate so he can accomplish a specific task, typically military.
Caesar was dictator for 11 days, in which he pardoned exiled criminals, restored rights to oppressed children, relieved debt, oversaw his own election to the Consul, and finally ceded his powers. Later, he was again granted dictatorship for one year to defeat some of Rome’s enemies in the middle east. He was swiftly victorious, and was made dictator for ten years by the Senate. He moved to consolidate his rule and form the empire by quelling opposition from the provinces, strengthening the central government in Rome, and bring together the provinces into one empire. Rome was previously the central piece in what was more a viscous collective than a solid empire. He maintained his power by granting himself greater authority and limiting the influence of the Senate. In just the five years between 49 BCE and 44 BCE, Caesar gained unimaginable power and his reforms are felt every day (especially on our calendars). His death left a question for the Senate: would Rome continue to enforce Caesar’s vision of a unified Roman Empire, or would it revert to the old republic. In the meantime, one of the largest power vacuums of history was waiting to be filled. Eventually overcoming all other contenders was Octavian, Caesar’s grand-nephew and heir, who took the title “princeps”, literally meaning “first citizen”. He ruled for life, from 27 BCE to 14 CE.

Class System

Cato The Elder
Roman society was thoroughly structured and hierarchical, with each class having more privileges than those below  them. This class system was simply the way of life for Romans. To them, this was normal, acceptable, justified, and just the way it  has always been. There was little guilt about or questioning of the pervasive slavery. It was seen as an axiom of life that higher classes were justified in exploiting those below them, and that they were intrinsically deserving of more than others. This belief was one of the core aspects of the Roman mindset: The strong rule the weak. They enslaved the people and armies they defeated.
This class system was legally defined, with different laws, rights and punishments for each class. Slaves, freed slaves, and freed criminals were some of the lowest tiered people. Slaves literally had no legal rights, and the others have barely more than that. Value in the class system is derived from power, and the tool of the elite is control of property and low social-mobility. The average citizen was a Plebian. Made up of most traditional roles one pictures: peasants, farmers, craftsmen. These Plebeians lived on and worked for the estate of a Patrician, who in turn gained some amount of power over those people. As in any contract, the common people cede some of their freedoms to the Patricians in exchange for something. The Elite’s power stemmed from their total monopoly on land, ensuring that each citizen lives on someone’s ‘territory’.
The phrase “rigid class hierarchy and slavery” near-universally triggers a negative reaction in people of the modern age. People’s morality reflect their world. Slavery was perceived by the romans, just as casually as a modern person would perceive poverty. Both Slavery and poverty are forms of oppression of a certain group by the elite, and while some Romans might have recognized something was wrong with it, on the whole their society accepted it. Modern times seem firm in their concern for poverty and inequality, but as of yet there has been little large-scale societal changes.
Class Inequality is tumorous in a society. As human morality shifts with the generations, each time period’s values are reflected in the laws they write, like layers of sediment. Every time in history has had some oppressed group, either for race, class, religion, or any other defining aspect of a group. Class privilege isn’t just a single law that can be changed or removed at will. Solving it requires massive societal changes that are far too radical to ever be feasible, and as such prejudice, while slowly but surely being whittled away, is still festering with the influence of the past. Inequality is hard-coded into the core of our society, and it has been since at least Ancient Rome.

Fall of Rome

Genseric Sacking Rome
Genseric
The Rome was sacked for the third time in 455 AD at the hands of the Vandal King Genseric. They had smashed the city’s aqueducts and marched into the capital of the Western Roman Empire, and had killed their emperor, Petronius Maximus. After their period of tremendous growth during the Pax Romana, the Roman Empire had conquered and expanded so much that their armies were now costing them money. Before, the military had been paying for itself with the spoils of their victories. But their armies were so massive that they could not conquer enough. Soldiers could not be paid by the state, making their armies as a whole less effective. Mistrust had formed between the state and the armies, which only grew as Emperor Severus Alexander continued to struggle in war. His generals, angered that Alexander had bribed their enemies, assassinated him so they could put Maximinus Thrax. This assassination and nigh military coup initiated a destabilizing of the empire. This instability eventually grew into the Middle Ages. Roman quality of life had worsened; politics, the economy, and the military were all in decline. The recession also meant less arts and sciences, and in turn less progress on a human-civilization scale.

&quot;Im in this image and I dont like it&quot;

It probably doesnt seem like it but I actually put a lot of work into this project. Its a very low bar, but I almost never complete solo assignments any amount of time more than the day before. To be honest this assignment has each element Ive struggled with. Difficult subject for me, self paced, just six days before I leave high school for good, and its all broken up into multiple pieces each just long enough where as soon as I finish one I have a headache, and for some reason I cant focus and I have to take a break. Its 3:02 am and im up cause im like way worse at this type of thing than I should be. Really I dont know why this is so hard for me. Like this is objectively not that difficult, just time consuming. But every time I would open up a document and start writing, within a few words my brain was empty or I was tripping over my words and in general had a weird feeling of wanting to distance myself from it. Probably something to do with avoiding the problem and hoping it goes away (literally what im doing right now like a dumbbutt).
Since Im already rambling I guess, I often get the sense that theres two parts of the brain. One is rational and can plan things out, can make unpleasant choices that sacrifice their short term for greater long term payoff. The other half gets to make the decisions day to day, like physically moving and talking. The executive can really only physically move for short whiles, eventually they always lose interest and give up control to the simpler, more efficient part of the brain. Pretty sure thats something to do with the id and ego and whatever but tbh I dont know what those words mean.
And its so frustrating, because youre simultaneously doing one thing while knowing its not productive and that you should be working to finish that huge final project due in like 4 hours. Im fully capable of planning and saying 'oh, I want to do this tomorrow so I cant do anything before that' but I still completely disregard my own plans.
Sorry, its difficult to describe that repelling feeling because its not really a feeling more so than it is just like a sense(? I have no clue sorry) but its kind of like two positive magnets. Theres nothing or physical concrete pushing them apart but it still takes a lot of work to get them to go together.
The last few weeks have not been busy, as much as they have been draining. Its been weirldly amazing and difficult year for me personally, and I know Im saying that as a 16 year old with basically 0 life experience, but I have had a lot of things this year, good and bad. The day to day has been weirldly half fantastic and half challenging. Thats as much as youre getting from my personal issues, cause Im really not trying to make excuses.
First off Im in this position 100% because of my own concious actions. At the end of the day anything I blame is really just some bit of me that I am still responsible for. All my brain stuff isnt gonna go away I have to figure out what to do.
All in all, Im pretty disappointed in my myself for this. I really have no idea why this is so difficult for me to do, but ya know.
This has actually been amazingly useful as a way to learn about what makes assignments difficult for me, and what I can do to still get them done. Throughout the last two weeks, Ive learned lots of new ways that I can work better. Working somewhere besides my room, making a detailed, step-by-step schedule of what Im going to do that night, and the importance of getting into a writing flow. Ive always done my assignemnts in one night before, and in my experience I have better odds of remaining engaged in a task if I can just put my head down and do the whole thing all at once.
Idk what this is Im just really tired and dead so idk enjoy the website its pretty sick actually not to flex
