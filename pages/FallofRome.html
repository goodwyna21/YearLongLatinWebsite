    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rome was sacked for the third time in 455 AD at the hands of the Vandal King Genseric. They had smashed the cityâ€™s aqueducts and marched into the capital of the Western Roman Empire, and had killed their emperor, Petronius Maximus. After their period of tremendous growth during the Pax Romana, the Roman Empire had conquered and expanded so much that their armies were now costing them money. Before, the military had been paying for itself with the spoils of their victories. But their armies were so massive that they could not conquer enough. Soldiers could not be paid by the state, making their armies as a whole less effective. Mistrust had formed between the state and the armies, which only grew as Emperor Severus Alexander continued to struggle in war. His generals, angered that Alexander had bribed their enemies, assassinated him so they could put Maximinus Thrax. This assassination and nigh military coup initiated a destabilizing of the empire. This instability eventually grew into the Middle Ages. Roman quality of life had worsened; politics, the economy, and the military were all in decline. The recession also meant less arts and sciences, and in turn less progress on a human-civilization scale.</p>
