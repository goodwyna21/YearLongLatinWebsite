    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slavery was omnipresent in Roman culture. Inequality was an accepted part of Roman life, stemming from the myth of Jupiter overthrowing Saturn. It was seen as an axiom of life that the strong rule over the weak, and that freedom was a privilege, not a right. In fact, many believed slaves were necessary for freedom itself. This belief of the Strong’s right to rule is most exemplified in the practice of taking a conquered enemy’s people as slaves. This was perceived as just, earned in victory. Slaves were acquired through conquest, slave trade, or on occasion through willingly selling oneself. Slavery was so normalized that parades of slaves with advertisements around their necks were found in almost every market and town square. In some places slaves made up almost 30 percent of the population. Some wealthy romans would have hundreds. Slaves were a status symbol, so the rich often flaunted their exotic or numerous slaves. Of course, not everybody owned slaves. The rich held the vast majority, but even a modest shop could have one or two.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaves legally had no rights. They could not own property, begin a family, or in any way exist without their owner. They were in essentially just another object owned. Slave labor was used in every aspect of roman life. Almost all unskilled labor was delegated to slaves or unpaid workers. Slave labor was most extensive in agriculture, mining, and in the home. The wealthy would have several slaves who tended to them in their day to day, and multitudes more working in their fields or on their estate.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding personal slaves who would be seen in public, slaves were kept in brutal conditions. Farm laborers would live in cramped barracks, chained together, and fed the bare minimum to keep them working. To their owners, slaves were only their labor, and thus they were not afforded any comfort. Slaves main benefit was their price, and any comfort would cost more and therefore make slaves overall less valuable.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roman slaves, though very rarely, could actually gain freedom. This freedom could be granted by their owner, but more often was purchased by the slave. Often this freedom was not absolute, for instance an owner might receive some portion of the freed slaves income, or could inherit the slaves property. The children of freed slaves were born free people.</p>
