    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rome is the archetypical ancient civilization. It was the sprawling empire that influenced science, math, arts, and medieval culture. In present day, Rome’s past lives on with the ruins of their creations. The winding streets surrounding the Roman forum, the archaeological site  flanked by a McDonalds and a Starbucks. One of the most iconic remnants of the Romans is the Coliseum, commissioned approximately around 70-72 AD by Emperor Vespasian as a gift to the Roman citizens. An ancient day stadium that could fill over 50,000 people, unlike any other early amphitheaters in that it was a freestanding structure, rather than carved out of a hill. There are 80 entrances into the Coliseum and it is believed to have had a rudimentary plumbing system, a luxury compared to the standard lifestyle of Roman citizens during that time period. The Coliseum once had an awning attached to its roof that could be extended over top of the sitting areas to protect the citizens from the sun. As one of the most impressive structures of its time, it served as a reminder of the state’s wealth and power.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To celebrate the inauguration, Vespasian’s son Titus began the 100 days of games.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the events: Animal games, executions of criminals, gladiatorial combat, and periodically flooding the arena to reenact famous naval battles.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the underlying motivations for building the Coliseum was that it was used to distract and control the masses of Roman citizens. The citizens would fill the seats, and be encapsulated by the people in the ring battle against each other or wild beast. Those who were the entertainment were prisoners, slaves, and those who wanted to show their bravery to the public eye. Winning events such as the Gladiators came with great honor and prizes of women and feasts. Some Emperors offered the citizens free food as a way to gain popularity and support from the public. no matter the social standard of the people.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the destruction from natural phenomenons and recklessness of the citizens destroying the ruins, the Coliseum was abandoned for more than one thousand years until a restoration project was started in 1990s. The Coliseum is now apart of millions of tourists dream destinations as they view a remarkable piece of architecture from the past.</p>
