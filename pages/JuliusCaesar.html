    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pax Romana was a period from roughly 27 BCE to 180 CE during which Rome experienced peace, stability, and expansion. Before this time, Rome had almost constantly been engaged in some major war, civil or otherwise. Roman citizens saw war as a good thing, because war meant conquest, conquest meant looting, capturing, enslaving, expanding, wealth, and power. Rome was at its largest during this time, reaching all the way to Asia. This period is often said to have begun with Octavian’s ascension after Julius Caesar. Caesar, a powerful governor returning home from his conquest of Gaul, had begun a civil war when he crossed into Rome with his legion against the Senate’s orders. He quickly defeated Pompey, his main opponent and powerful Senator, and became the dictator. Roman dictatorship, similar to martial law, bestowed the full authority of the state on a magistrate so he can accomplish a specific task, typically military.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caesar was dictator for 11 days, in which he pardoned exiled criminals, restored rights to oppressed children, relieved debt, oversaw his own election to the Consul, and finally ceded his powers. Later, he was again granted dictatorship for one year to defeat some of Rome’s enemies in the middle east. He was swiftly victorious, and was made dictator for ten years by the Senate. He moved to consolidate his rule and form the empire by quelling opposition from the provinces, strengthening the central government in Rome, and bring together the provinces into one empire. Rome was previously the central piece in what was more a viscous collective than a solid empire. He maintained his power by granting himself greater authority and limiting the influence of the Senate. In just the five years between 49 BCE and 44 BCE, Caesar gained unimaginable power and his reforms are felt every day (especially on our calendars). His death left a question for the Senate: would Rome continue to enforce Caesar’s vision of a unified Roman Empire, or would it revert to the old republic. In the meantime, one of the largest power vacuums of history was waiting to be filled. Eventually overcoming all other contenders was Octavian, Caesar’s grand-nephew and heir, who took the title “princeps”, literally meaning “first citizen”. He ruled for life, from 27 BCE to 14 CE.</p>
