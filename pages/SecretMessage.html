    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It probably doesnt seem like it but I actually put a lot of work into this project. Its a very low bar, but I almost never complete solo assignments any amount of time more than the day before. To be honest this assignment has each element Ive struggled with. Difficult subject for me, self paced, just six days before I leave high school for good, and its all broken up into multiple pieces each just long enough where as soon as I finish one I have a headache, and for some reason I cant focus and I have to take a break. Its 3:02 am and im up cause im like way worse at this type of thing than I should be. Really I dont know why this is so hard for me. Like this is objectively not that difficult, just time consuming. But every time I would open up a document and start writing, within a few words my brain was empty or I was tripping over my words and in general had a weird feeling of wanting to distance myself from it. Probably something to do with avoiding the problem and hoping it goes away (literally what im doing right now like a dumbbutt).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Im already rambling I guess, adhd means I have some difficulty in my prefrontal cortext with executive functioning. Im fairly certain whats going on is day to day simple tasks are delegated to a more efficient simpler part of the brain, then in long-term planning or complex tasks a more complicated or something part takes over. I think (With no basis for this but my own experience) that my issue is the complex part can perfectly plan out what I should do like &quot;Do one passage a day, takes like 45 minutes no prob&quot; but then when time comes to it the simple part just doesnt listen to the executive functioning. Or sometimes I will be sitting at my desk and my thoughts are saying &quot;aight just do a little work no biggie&quot; then I just dont and its so frustrating cause theyre both me but Im not following my own plan. Gah!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its so frustrating, because youre simultaneously doing one thing while knowing its not productive and that you should be working to finish that huge final project due in like 4 hours. Im fully capable of planning and saying 'oh, I want to do this tomorrow so I cant do anything before that' but I still completely disregard my own plans.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, its difficult to describe that repelling feeling because its not really a feeling more so than it is just like a sense(? I have no clue sorry) but its kind of like two positive magnets. Theres nothing or physical concrete pushing them apart but it still takes a lot of work to get them to go together.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last few weeks have not been busy, as much as they have been draining. Its been weirldly amazing and difficult year for me personally, and I know Im saying that as a 16 year old with basically 0 life experience, but I have had a lot of things this year, good and bad. The day to day has been weirldly half fantastic and half challenging. Thats as much as youre getting from my personal issues, cause Im really not trying to make excuses.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First off Im in this position 100% because of my own conscious actions. At the end of the day anything I blame is really just some bit of me that I am still responsible for. All my brain stuff isnt gonna go away I have to figure out what to do.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, Im pretty disappointed in my myself for this. I really have no idea why this is so difficult for me to do, but ya know.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has actually been amazingly useful as a way to learn about what makes assignments difficult for me, and what I can do to still get them done. Throughout the last two weeks, Ive learned lots of new ways that I can work better. Working somewhere besides my room, making a detailed, step-by-step schedule of what Im going to do that night, and the importance of getting into a writing flow. Ive always done my assignemnts in one night before, and in my experience I have better odds of remaining engaged in a task if I can just put my head down and do the whole thing all at once.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idk what this is Im just really tired and dead so idk enjoy the website its pretty sick actually not to flex</p></p>
