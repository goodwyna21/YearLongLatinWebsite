  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roman society was thoroughly structured and hierarchical, with each class having more privileges than those below  them. This class system was simply the way of life for Romans. To them, this was normal, acceptable, justified, and just the way it  has always been. There was little guilt about or questioning of the pervasive slavery. It was seen as an axiom of life that higher classes were justified in exploiting those below them, and that they were intrinsically deserving of more than others. This belief was one of the core aspects of the Roman mindset: The strong rule the weak. They enslaved the people and armies they defeated.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This class system was legally defined, with different laws, rights and punishments for each class. Slaves, freed slaves, and freed criminals were some of the lowest tiered people. Slaves literally had no legal rights, and the others have barely more than that. Value in the class system is derived from power, and the tool of the elite is control of property and low social-mobility. The average citizen was a Plebian. Made up of most traditional roles one pictures: peasants, farmers, craftsmen. These Plebeians lived on and worked for the estate of a Patrician, who in turn gained some amount of power over those people. As in any contract, the common people cede some of their freedoms to the Patricians in exchange for something. The Elite’s power stemmed from their total monopoly on land, ensuring that each citizen lives on someone’s ‘territory’.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase “rigid class hierarchy and slavery” near-universally triggers a negative reaction in people of the modern age. People’s morality reflect their world. Slavery was perceived by the romans, just as casually as a modern person would perceive poverty. Both Slavery and poverty are forms of oppression of a certain group by the elite, and while some Romans might have recognized something was wrong with it, on the whole their society accepted it. Modern times seem firm in their concern for poverty and inequality, but as of yet there has been little large-scale societal changes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class Inequality is tumorous in a society. As human morality shifts with the generations, each time period’s values are reflected in the laws they write, like layers of sediment. Every time in history has had some oppressed group, either for race, class, religion, or any other defining aspect of a group. Class privilege isn’t just a single law that can be changed or removed at will. Solving it requires massive societal changes that are far too radical to ever be feasible, and as such prejudice, while slowly but surely being whittled away, is still festering with the influence of the past. Inequality is hard-coded into the core of our society, and it has been since at least Ancient Rome.</p>
