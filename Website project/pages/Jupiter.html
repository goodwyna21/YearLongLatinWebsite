      <p>It was foretold that Saturn would be overthrown by one of his own sons. He swallowed each of his children, Ceres, Vesta, Juno, Pluto and Neptune, as infants to protect himself. His sixth child, Jupiter, was saved by his mother Rhea, who instead gave Saturn a swaddled stone. Jupiter was raised in secret, and when he was grown he gave his father an emetic, freeing his brothers and sisters from their father. Jupiter freed the Hecatonchires and Cyclopes, who made Jupiterâ€™s iconic lightning bolt as a weapon against the Titans. Jupiter and his siblings  overthrew the Titans, and began their rule. Jupiter became the King of the Gods, god of the sky and thunder.</p>
